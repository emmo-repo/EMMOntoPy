"""An example script that uses EMMO to describe a vertical use case on
welding aluminium to steel and how the thin layer of intermetallic
that are formed at the interface is influencing the overall
properties.  Based on TEM observations using scanning precision
electron diffraction (SPED) the following (simplified) sequence of
intermetallic phases could be established:

    Al | alpha-AlFeSi | Fe4Al13 | Fe2Al5 | Fe

which is consistent with phase stability when the Fe-concentration is
increasing when going from left to right.

In this case study three scales are considered:

  - Macroscopic scale: predicts the overall mechanical behaviour of
    the welded structure during deformation.

  - Microscopic scale: a local crystal plasticity model of a small
    part of the interface.  The constitutive equations were based on
    the results from DFT.  The results from this model was used to
    calibrate decohesion elements for the macroscopic scale.

  - Electronic scale: elastic properties of the individual phases as
    well work of decohesion within and at the interfaces between the
    phases were calculated with DFT [1].  The calculation of work of
    decohesion was performed as a series of rigid steps, providing
    stress-strain relations in both tensile and shear.
